# Ansible Role: Swap

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-swap/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-swap/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

An Ansible Role that configures swap space on Linux.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    swap_file_path: /swapfile

The location of the swap file on the server.

    swap_file_size_mb: '512'

How large (in mebibytes) to make the swap file.

    swap_swappiness: '60'

The `vm.swappiness` value to be configured in sysconfig. To keep the current `vm.swappiness` set this to a YAML null value (e.g. `swap_swappiness: null`).

    swap_file_state: present

If you wish to _remove_ your swapfile, and disable swap, set this to `absent`. Generally you'd probably want to set this to `present`.

    swap_file_create_command: "dd if=/dev/zero of={{ swap_file_path }} bs=1M count={{ swap_file_size_mb }}"

The command used to create the swap file. You could switch to using `fallocate` to write the swap file more quickly, though there may be inconsistencies if not writing the file with `dd`.

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: all
    
      vars:
        swap_file_size_mb: '1024'
    
      roles:
        - geerlingguy.swap
